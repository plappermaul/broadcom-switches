/**
 *  
 * The purpose of this package is to provide an easy way to 
 * create a threads.
 *  
 * A thread can be created by using
 * shr_thread_manager_create, by giving: 
 *  -. name
 *  -. interval
 *  -. callback for periodic execution.
 *  
 * Additional facilities given by this package:
 *  -. Having the ability to trigger the thread for immediate
 *   operation.
 *  -. Having the ability to start\stop the thread.
 *  -. Having the ability to send void* user data for the
 *   callback usage.
 *  -. Providing thread priority.
 *  -. Having error threshold - if the callback failed X time
 *   thread will automatically exit.
 *  
 * Notes:
 *  -. To free allocated memory shr_thread_manager_destroy should be
 *   called when thread is no longer required, or upon deinit.
 *  -. Non of the information is WB protected - thread
 *   must be re-created after WB.
