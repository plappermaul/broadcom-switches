/*  FUNCTION NAME:  utils_dune_AlteraDownload
**  FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:
**  FORMAL PARAMENETS:
**   unsigned char *base_addr  - Beginning address of memory stream to download.
**                               if NULL, then the default ROM file is taken.
**   unsigned long  size       - Size in bytes of that stream. can be '0', in
**                               base_addr is NULL
**  RETURN VALUE:
**    an unsigned integer typed returned:
**     -0  - download OK.
**     -10 - Device was not ready to download (Jumper is probably plugged)
**     -20 - Device had a problem while downloading.
**     -30 - Device had a problem after downloading.
**
**  DESIGN ISSUES:
**    The FPGA by ALTERA needs to be downloaded with a configuration stream
**    after each power-up (Power-Up, NOT Reset!).
**    (The configuration stream is held here above).
**    1). Download emulation facility:
**        The CPU is equipped with 2 I/O port we use to
**        emulate the download sequence to the ALTERA.
**        There are 3 output bits supplied by the Manager towards the
**        FPGA on port B. The FPGA provides 2 status bits that can be read
**        by the Manager in order to monitor the sequence flow on port C.
**    2). Download emulation flow:
**        We use the "passive serial mode" to download the FPGAs. The flow
**        looks as follows:
**        NConfig  _     _____________________________________\\________________
**                |___|                                      \\
**        NStatus  __      _____________________________________||______________
**                   |____|                                     ||
**        ConfDone __                                           ||            ___
**                   |__________________________________________||___________|
**                                __    __    __    __    __    ||_    __    __
**        Dclk     _|||__________|  |__|  |__|  |__|  |__|  |__|||.|__|  |__|  |__
**                              ____  ____  ____  ____  ____  __||__  ____
**        Dout     ------------<_D0_><_D1_><_D2_><_D3_><_D4_><___\\_><_Dn_>-------
**                                                                \\
**        The flow is devided into three stages:
**        -. INIT:
**                Write 'NConfig' = 0;
**                Wait 100mSec
**                Write 'NConfig' = 1;
**
**        -. PROGRAM:
**             -> Write 'Dout'.
**            |   Wait >30nSec
**            |   Write 'Dclk' = 1
**            |   Wait >50nSec
**            |   Write 'Dclk' = 0
**            |   Wait >50nSec
**            |   Read 'NStatus' : if '0' - Device had error.
**            |_________|
**
**        -. MONITOR SUCCESS:
**                Write 'Dclk' = 1
**                Wait >100nSec
**                Read ConfDone : If '0' - Device didn't configured well.
**                run 10 'Dclk' ticks.
**
**        For more details look at application note #59 from altera:
**        "Configuring Flex 10K devices" - Passive serial mode.
**        Notice I added a bunch of clocks around the NConfig falling edge. This
**        was done to fully emulate the behavior of the 'Byte-Blaster' cable.
