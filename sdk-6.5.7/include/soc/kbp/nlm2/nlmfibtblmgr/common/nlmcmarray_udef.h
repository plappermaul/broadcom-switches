/*@@NlmCmArray Undefine Module
   Summary
   This module is used to undefine specific macros.

   Description
   If we are being included by a normal app, then we need to undefine all the important
   macros so that multiple tree implementations can co-exist in an app.

   We also must undefine Type and Method because the real names must be used for
   implementation purposes rather than the #define's we use. Otherwise, they may interfere
   with apps or become incompatible/unusable with multiple uses of this template.
