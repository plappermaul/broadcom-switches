 *       BCM_E_* otherwise as appropriate
 *   Notes
 *     The 'available' set includes all stats that are available in the current
 *     mode, both native and emulated.
 *
 *     The 'native' set includes all stats that are supported natively by the
 *     current hardware mode.
 *
 *     Here 'native' refers to stats that are directly supported by the current
 *     hardware mode, while 'emulated' refers to stats that can be derived by
 *     combining 'native' stats in some way.  For example, if the current
 *     hardware mode provides {drop green, drop yellow, drop red}, it is
 *     possible to emulate {drop all, drop not green, drop not yellow, drop not
 *     red} from the native information.
 *
 *     In error case, both avail and native will be cleared.
 *
 *     Current and next generation (Soc_petra and Arad) do not support multiple
 *     modes per counter processor, so this only takes counter processor as the
 *     argument to determine the mode.  May change in distant future.
