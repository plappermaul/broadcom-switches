/*
 * BCM Locking
 *
 * (1) BCM calls that need to perform multiple operations on a resource
 *     atomically, such as read/modify/write a table entry, should lock
 *     the resource.
 *
 * (2) Module routines that call outside their module must be very
 *     careful to avoid deadlocks.  Deadlocks result from two or more
 *     threads trying to take the same locks but in a different order.
 *
 * (3) BCM_LOCK should be taken during all major configuration changes
 *     to prevent corruption that could result if two tasks (like a CLI
 *     and a SNMP server) try to alter configuration simultaneously.
 *
 * (4) BCM_LOCK may also be useful in avoiding deadlocks if multiple
 *     resources are needed.
