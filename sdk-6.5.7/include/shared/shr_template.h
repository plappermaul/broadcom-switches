 *   Notes
 *      A template pool must be configured before any resources can point to

 *
 *      The underlying template management information will be created during
 *      this call.  If this call is made again for the same template pool, and
 *      there are no resources using this pool, the old information will be
 *      destroyed and the new will be created in its stead, but if resources
 *      are already using this pool, the call will fail.
 *
 *      Most of the allocation managers require some extra arguments, so the
 *      extras argument is likely obligatory.  Each allocation manager has its
 *      own addiitonal arguments, for specific behavioural control or
 *      optimisation, and the correct extras type must be used accordingly.
 *
 *      This must be called after init, and before a pool can be used, even
 *      before a resource can be assigned to the pool.
 *
 *      Note that name and extras will be copied internally, and so the memory
 *      underlying those can be reused by the caller once this call completes.
 *
 *      All templates will be initialised to the value specified by data_value,
 *      unless it is NULL, in which case the templates values will be zeroed.
 *      Templates are not guaranteed to be returned to this value when freed.
 *
 *      The template with ID specified by template_init_id will be considered
 *      allocated with template_init_cnt references.  If this feature is not
 *      to be used, set template_init_cnt to zero.

/*
 *   Function
 *      shr_template_exchange
 *   Purpose
 *      Free a current template and allocate a new one for new data
 *   Parameters
 *      (IN) unit     	   : unit number of the device
 *      (IN) template_type : which template type to use
 *      (IN) flags    	   : flags providing specifics of what/how to set
 *      (IN) data          : data to be in the template
 *      (IN) old_template  : is the old template to free
 *      (OUT) is_last      : is the template last pointed
 *      (IN/OUT) template_param  : where to map the resource.
 *      (OUT) is_allocated : is the new template first pointed
 *   Returns
 *      BCM_E_NONE if successful
 *      BCM_E_NOT_FOUND, BCM_E_EXISTS - See notes.
 *      BCM_E_INTERNAL - Internal error.
 *      BCM_E_MEMORY - No memory.
 *      BCM_E_PARAM - Invalid parameters.
 *      BCM_E_* - Other (and also these) errors may be returned from copying the hash key.
 *   Notes
 *      The template_param argument is IN if the WITH_ID flag is specified; it is OUT if
 *      the WITH_ID flag is not specified.
 * 
 *      Whether WITH_ID is provided or not, if the allocation / update was successful,
 *      the template with ID provided in old_template will be freed.  Note this only
 *      happens if the selection of a new template succeeds, so the old template
 *      should not be reclaimed if this function fails.
 *      If old_template wasn't allocated before, and the flag IGNORE_NOT_EXIST_OLD_TEMPLATE
 *      is not set, then BCM_E_PARAM will be returned. If the flag is set, then a new refrence
 *      will be allocated without deleting the old one.
 * 
 *      If WITH_ID is set and the template specified in *template_param is not yet allocated,
 *      this will allocate it and set its data to the specified data. 
 * 
 *      If WITH_ID is set but IGNORE_DATA is not, and the specified template in *template_param is
 *      allocated, the data of the template will be changed to the new data.
 *      However if the data already exists with a different index, then BCM_E_EXISTS
 *      is returned (if the user wishes for the same key to be used for two different
 *      indices, it is possible to insert the index itself in the data which will
 *      automatically differentiate them).
 *
 *      If WITH_ID and IGNORE_DATA are both set, this will increment the reference
 *      count for the specified template.
 *      If the template does not exist then BCM_E_NOT_FOUND is returned.
 * 
 *      If WITH_ID is clear, this will look for a in-use template whose data are
 *      'equal' to the specified data.  If it finds such a template, it will
 *      increment that template's reference count and return it.  If it does not
 *      find such a template, it marks an available template as in use, sets its
 *      reference count to 1, copies the data to the template's data, and returns
 *      this template.  If there is no 'equal' or free template, BCM_E_RESOURCE.
 *
 *
 *      Whether WITH_ID is provided or not, on success the int pointed to by the
 *      is_allocated argument will be updated.  It will be set TRUE if the new
 *      template was free before, and FALSE if the new template was already in use.
 *      If the value is TRUE, appropriate resources should be updated by the caller
 *      (such as programming the data values to hardware registers).
 *
 *      It is not valid to specify IGNORE_DATA without WITH_ID.

 *   Function

 *   Notes
 *      This function only tests the the following configuration asked can be set,

 *      
 *      The template_param argument is IN if the WITH_ID flag is specified; it is OUT if

 *
 *      If WITH_ID is set and the specified template is not yet allocated, this
 *      will allocate it and set its data to the specified data.
 *
 *      If WITH_ID is set but IGNORE_DATA is not, and the specified template is
 *      allocated, this will first verify that the new data are 'equal' to the
 *      existing data for the template, and: if so, will increment the reference
 *      count for the specified template; if not, will return BCM_E_EXISTS.
 *
 *      If WITH_ID and IGNORE_DATA are both set, this will increment the reference
 *      count for the specified template.  Note that this mode is intended only to
 *      be used as a shortcut for 'freeing' the referring entity while mapping its
 *      template back to a 'standard' or 'default' template.
 *
 *      If WITH_ID is clear, this will look for a in-use template whose data are
 *      'equal' to the specified data.  If it finds such a template, it will
 *      increment that template's reference count and return it.  If it does not
 *      find such a template, it marks an available template as in use, sets its
 *      reference count to 1, copies the data to the template's data, and returns
 *      this template.  If there is no 'equal' or free template, BCM_E_RESOURCE.
 *
 *      If the new template is successfully chosen, the template with ID provided
 *      in old_template will be freed.  Note this only happens if the selection of
 *      a new template succeeds, so the old template should not be reclaimed if
 *      this function fails.
 *
 *      Whether WITH_ID is provided or not, on success the int pointed to by the
