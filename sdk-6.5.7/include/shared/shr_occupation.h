 * 
 * Global occupation management
 * 
 * Provides a mechanism to allocate and manipulate bits (henceforth "items")
 * in a bitmap (henceforth "map"), according to input constraints.
 * After the allocation, the user can get and set the items in the map,
 * referring to them only by their IDs.
 * 
 * Allowed constraints:
 *   An item may require to have a certain amount of bits.
 *   An item can specify which bits may be allocated for it.
 * 
 * 
 * Example and usage guidelines:
 * -----------------------------
 * 
 *   The challenge:
 *      We have a "bag" of size 4 bits [0-3].
 *   We want to put 3 "artifacts" in this bag:
 *      - notebook: requires one bit.
 *      - bottle: requires one of the two MSBs.
 *                That is, only bits 2 or 3 may be allocated for the bottle.
 *      - laptop: requires two bits of the three LSBs.
 * 
 *   The Solution:
 *      To solve this problem we will create a map of size 4 to represent the bag.
 *          functions in use: shr_occ_map_args_init(), shr_occ_map_create.
 *      Then we will add the 3 items to represent the artifcats.
 *          functions in use: shr_occ_item_init(), shr_occ_map_add_item().
 *      Then we can solve these constraints and allocate bits for the items in the map.
 *          functions in use: shr_occ_map_solve().
 * 
 *   This solution is not exposed for the user - the user doesn't know which bits are allocated
 *   for each item. He only knows that the constrains are maintained.
 * 
 *   Saving and Using the solution:
 *          In order to save and load the solution, the user passes "save" and "load" callbacks to
 *      the map_args_init function.
 *          The user can then access the items and set their values from 0 to 2^(b-1),
 *      where 'b' is the number of bits the item required.
 *          For that he can use the provided access function: shr_occ_mgmt_item_access().
 *      This function takes as argument a "bag" item that represents the current bag state (the values of its itmes).
 *      Then using the item's ID in the access function, only the item-relevant part of the
 *      bag will be changed (on "set") / returned (on "get").
 * 
 *   For a code reference, you can take a look at:
 *   sdk/src/soc/dpp/ARAD/ARAD_PP/arad_pp_occupation_mgmt.c
 *   functions: arad_pp_occ_mgmt_init_inlif_profile(), arad_pp_occ_mgmt_app_get(), arad_pp_occ_mgmt_app_set().
