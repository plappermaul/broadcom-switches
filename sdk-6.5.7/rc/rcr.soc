# Reload script
#
#	A system reload is when the software is restarted from scratch
#	*without* the hardware being reset in any way.  The software
#	will read the current state out of the hardware and resume as if
#	nothing had happened.
#
#	This script is the reload counterpart to the rc.soc script.
#	It calls all the steps needed during the reload process to
#	restore each subsystem.
#
#	To use reload mode, the boot flag must be set to indicate reload.
#	In this mode, the BCM command monitor will attach all devices
#	and come to the prompt non-destructively.  Then this script is
#	run to bring all the software modules through reload initialization.
#	
#	Assumes the same board configuration config variables are set
#	that rc.soc uses.
