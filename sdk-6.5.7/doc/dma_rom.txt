				dma_rom
		   Simplified API for Polled Mode DMA
	       Jeff Townsend and Curt McDowell, 04-24-03

This API is at the SOC layer in soc/dma.c.  It provides a way to do
packet DMA that does not need any high level constructs such as threads,
semaphores, or interrupts, and therefore is suitable for use in such
applications as a Boot ROM.

All the parameters required for transmitting and receiving packets are
passed and returned in the opaque data type soc_dcb_t, which is a
chip-specific DMA descriptor.  The caller must setup the DCB structure
correctly for the chip on which the packet will be transmitted.  Also,
on the BCM5670 series fabric chips, the packet data must contain the
12-byte Higig header.

All routines here are non-blocking and return immediately.  DMA transmit
and receive operations are left outstanding in the background to
complete in parallel with other code execution.  A receive DMA is always
left outstanding so if a packet is present, it will already be sitting
in memory by the time the application polls for it.

EXAMPLES:

The following examples demonstrate how to use the API.  Error checking
is omitted in the examples, but it is important that thorough error
checking is always done on all API calls.  Please see the function
header comments in soc/dma.c for more detailed information.

/* 
 *  Example 1: Initializing and Finalizing
 */

int dma_main(int unit)
{
    /* Initialize DMA on the unit, maximum packet size of 2000 bytes */
    soc_dma_rom_init(unit, 2000); 
    
    /* TX/RX packets... */

    /* Cleanup */
    soc_dma_rom_detach(unit); 
    
    return 0; 
}

/*
 * Example 2: Transmitting a packet:
 */

int simple_port_tx(int unit, int port, uint8 *pkt, len)
{
    dcb_t *dcb;
    dcb_type_t dt;
    int done;
    void *p;

    /* Allocate a packet DCB */
    dcb = soc_dma_rom_dcb_alloc(unit, len); 
    
    /* Copy our packet into the DCB's buffer */
    /* This packet must be fully formed for the port it will transmit on. */
    dt = soc_dcb_type(unit); 
    p = soc_dcb_addr_get(unit, dt, dcb); 
    memcpy(p, pkt, len); 

    /* Program the port bitmap */
    soc_dcb_tx_pbm_l2_set(dt, dcb, PBMP_PORT(port));
    
    /* Untagged port bitmap */
    soc_dcb_tx_pbm_ut_set(dt, dcb, PBMP_PORT(port));

    /* Start the transmit */
    soc_dma_rom_tx_start(unit, dcb); 

    /* Simple Poll for completion */
    done = 0; 
    while (!done) {
	soc_dma_rom_tx_poll(unit, &done); 
    }

    /*
     * In the case that your polling loop implements a timeout, you
     * would need to clean up by calling soc_dma_rom_tx_abort(unit).
     */

    /* Must free the DCB after the packet has been transmitted */
    soc_dma_rom_dcb_free(unit, dcb); 

    return 0; 
}

/*
 * Example 3: Receiving a packet:
 */

int simple_rx(int unit, uint8 *pkt, int *len, int* port)
{
    dcb_t dcb;
    dcb_type_t dt;
    void *p;

    /* Is a packet available? */
    soc_dma_rom_rx_poll(unit, &dcb);
    if (dcb == NULL) {
	/* No packet available */
	return NO_PACKET; 
    }

    /* Retrieve the packet data from the DCB */
    dt = soc_dcb_type(unit); 
    p = soc_dcb_addr_get(unit, dt, dcb); 
    *len = soc_dcb_addr_xfer_cnt_get(dt, dcb); 
    
    memcpy(pkt, p, *len); 
    
    *port = soc_dcb_rx_sp_get(dt, dcb); 

    /* 
     * The DCB contains a lot of other useful information related
     * to the packet's ingress as well:
     *
     *	cos    = soc_dcb_rx_cos_get(dt, dcb); 
     *	reason = soc_dcb_rx_op_get(dt, dcb); 
     *	opcode = soc_dcb_rx_hg_mhop_get(dt, dcb); 		(5690 only)
     *	source_mod = soc_dcb_rx_hg_sm_get(dt, dcb); 		(5690 only)
     *	source_port = soc_dcb_rx_hg_sp_get(dt, dcb); 		(5690 only)
     *	etc..
     *
     * See $SDK/include/soc/dcb.h for all available accessors
     */

    /* Done with this packet, need to free the DCB */
    soc_dma_rom_dcb_free(unit, dcb);

    return GOT_PACKET;
