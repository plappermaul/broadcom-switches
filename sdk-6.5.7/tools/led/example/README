This directory contains assembler code examples for the 5605 LED
processor.  Contained herein are:

Directory Contents

    ex1.asm to ex5.asm --
	Progressively more complicated examples of LED driver programs.
	Note: Each example assumes a hypothetical LED scan chain length
	and configuration.  These examples will run on the 5605 SDK, but
	will not light LEDs as expected.

    testasm.asm --
	Test source.  Contains all legal instruction variations in
	numeric order.  Assemble the source, look at the listing and
	make sure all opcodes are assigned properly.

    sdk5605.asm --
	Default LED program for the BCM5605 SDK.
	This program is correct for the BCM5605 SDK where there are
	104 bits in the LED scan chain, two per tri-color LED.
	Link up/down information is derived from special memory
	locations written by the main CPU.
	See comments in the source code for a description of LED functions.
