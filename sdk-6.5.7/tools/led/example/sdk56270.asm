;
; This is the program used for testing the BCM56270 SVK with LED board.
; To start it, use the following commands from BCM:
;
;       led 0 load sdk56270.hex
;       led 0 auto on
;       led 0 start
;
; TEST LED board used . 1 LED per port is considered. 
; There are two bits per  LED with the following colors:
;       ZERO, ZERO      Black
;       ZERO, ONE       Amber
;       ONE, ZERO       Green
;
; Each chip drives only its own LEDs and needs to write them in the order:
;       LA01, LA02, ..., LA04
;
; Link up/down info cannot be derived from LINKEN or LINKUP, as the LED
; processor does not always have access to link status.  This program
; assumes link status is kept current in bit 0 of RAM byte (0xA0 + portnum).
; Generally, a program running on the main CPU must update these
; locations on link change; see linkscan callback in
; $SDK/src/appl/diag/ledproc.c.
;
; Current implementation as below and is being tested with TEST LED board:
;
; LA01 reflects port 1 link/activity status:
;       Black: no link
;       Green: Link
;       Green Blink: Activity
;

TICKS           EQU     1
SECOND_TICKS    EQU     (30*TICKS)

MIN_PORT        EQU     1
MAX_PORT        EQU     12

NUM_PORT        EQU     12

;
; Main Update Routine
;
; This routine is called once per tick.
;

update:
        call    delay
        ld      a, MIN_PORT

up1:
        port    a
        ld      (PORT_NUM),a
        call    delay
        call    delay
        call    activity        

        ld      a,(PORT_NUM)
        inc     a
        cmp     a, MAX_PORT+1 
        jnz     up1

        ; Update various timers

up2:
        send    12 *2 ;  

;
; activity
;
; This routine calculates the activity LED for the current port.
; It extends the activity lights using timers (new activity overrides
; and resets the timers).
;
; Inputs: (PORT_NUM)
; Outputs: Two bits sent to LED stream
