KBP Device Driver instructions
==============================

The KBP device driver identifies any PCIE capable KBP devices
connected to the root complex and prepares them for use by the
software API's. Devices discovered are populated as files under
/proc/kbp/pcie<id>. The driver also allocates the required system
memory to enable DMA operations between the KBP SDK and the chip.

The rest of this document provides sample commands/steps to configure the
system to load the driver.

Driver components
-----------------

The device driver directory contains the following files

 ->     README        (Instructions and documentation)
 ->     kbp_driver.c  (Device driver implementation)
 ->     kbp_driver.h  (interface between driver and SDK)
 ->     Makefile      (Sample Makefile)

Compilation
-----------

The provided Makefile needs to be modified to point to the
appropriate toolchains and kernel sources. On typing make
the driver module kbp_driver.ko will be built.

Usage
-----

$ insmod kbp_driver.ko [verbose=] [req_q_size=] [resp_q_size=]

  req_q_size:       The size of DMA buffer for transfers from software to KBP.
                    Acceptable values are between 0x1 and 0xE. The default is
                    0x1 and the customer is not expected to change this.

  resp_q_size:      The size of DMA buffer for responses from KBP to software.
                    Acceptable values are between 0x1 and 0xE. The default is
                    0x1 and the customer is not expected to change this.

  verbose:          Setting this to 0 will cause the driver to emit only critical
                    messages. Default is 1 where additional details are printed
                    by the driver

  pcie_bus_mapping: Specify the bus mapping to KBP PCIE id in the following
                    string format

                    "<bus_number>,<id>|<bus_number>,<id>"

                    Please note this mapping needs to be specified as a string
                    to the driver, and care must be taken the quotes get passed
                    down properly all the way to the driver command line and
                    not eaten by the shell or scripts. For example the option
                    can be used as

                    insmod kbp_driver.ko pcie_bus_mapping='"0000:01:00.1,100|0000:04:00.0,13"'

                    Please note the extra quotes.


Querying status of device after installation
--------------------------------------------

After the driver is installed one proc file is created for every discovered
device under /proc/kbp

$ ls /proc/kbp
  pcie0 pcie1 pcie2 pcie3

Each of the files can be queried for status.

$ cat /proc/kbp/pcie0
Device Type    : Direct PCIE connect to DUT
Driver Version : KBP_PCIE_DRIVER_1.6
Status         : Available
PCI Device     : 0000:01:00.0
       config.register_map_base_phys = 0xf0100000
       config.register_map_size = 4096
ioctl the /proc file from your process to obtain the virtual
address of the register map
=======================================================
Driver Assigned DMA memory
=======================================================
DMA Memory: 0x0000000000080000  |  size: 0x00004180
DMA REQUEST Q OFFSETS: base: 0x0, size: 1024, head: 0x4040, tail: 0x4080
DMA RESPONSE Q OFFSETS: base: 0x2000, size: 1024, head: 0x40c0, tail: 0x4100
....
....

Controlling enumeration order
-----------------------------

The device driver assigns a device ID starting from zero to each KBP
discovered in the order in which the kernel notifies the driver. If the
customer requires controlling the assignment of ID to the KBP this can
be done by specifying the bus number to KBP PCIE ID mapping on the
driver command line or by modifying kbp_driver.c as shown below

insmod kbp_driver.ko pcie_bus_mapping='"0000:01:00.1,100|0000:04:00.0,13"'

In the following case the following mapping would be created

   "0000:01:00.1" --> /proc/kbp/pcie100
   "0000:04:00.0" --> /proc/kbp/pcie13

Any devices outside of the table will get assigned ID's
starting after the largest ID in the table above. In the above case
the first ID assigned would be 101

Alternately the file kbp_driver.c can be modified and the string above
can be assigned to the variable

static char *pcie_bus_mapping="0000:01:00.1,100|0000:04:00.0,13"
