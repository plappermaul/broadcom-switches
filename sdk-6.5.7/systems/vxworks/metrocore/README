            VxWorks BSP for NSX (BCM1125) Card
		  Broadcom Corp 6/10/2004

This directory contains the VxWorks BSP for running VxWorks on the
BCM1125 processor card.  This BSP was originally derived from
the SiByte SWARM BSP for BCM1250.

Broadcom Common Firmware Environment (CFE) is used as the boot ROM
to boot VxWorks image directly from on board flash or over network.
CFE is modified to emulate VxWorks boot ROM.

Simple flash filesystem based on DOSFS 2.0, with 15 MB usable space
on the "flash:" device, CLI commands are provided for common file
operations.

This file documents BSP interface changes from previous software or
hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats that
must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's manual page entry (e.g., man bcm1250) provides board-specific
information necessary to run VxWorks.  The target manual page should
be read fully before this BSP is used.
