Build Hints
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAKE_PAR

	Set this environment variable to "-j" to achieve fast
	parallel builds of the BCM drivers.

NO_BCM

	Typing "gmake" in a systems/<TARGETBASE>/<TARGETPLAT> directory
	ordinarily builds bcm_libraries, driver_libraries, then the BSP,
	and links.  You can use "gmake NO_BCM=1" to avoid recompiling
	bcm_libraries driver_libraries if they are already built to your
	satisfaction.

DEBUG_OPTIMIZE

	When debugging, use "setenv DEBUG_OPTIMIZE FALSE" to turn off
	the -O flag.  Optimization severely cripples debugger accuracy.
	If DEBUG_OPTIMIZE is TRUE or not set, high optimization is used.
	Alternately you can set DEBUG_OPTIMIZE to your own option string
	such as "-O3".

BSP Descriptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

vxworks/mousse

	Complete VxWorks BSP for the Broadcom Mousse PowerPC processor
	card.  This BSP was originally derived from the Motorola
	Sandpoint BSP for MPC8240 (Kahlua), but no longer has much in
	common with it.  Has support for MMU mapping of the BCM56xx.
	A primitive flash disk driver is provided, which works fine
	but is slow and lacks features like wear-leveling (i.e. it
	should really only be used for static data).

	Use "make" or "make bcm" to generate bcm.mousse.  This same
	image will work on all supported BCM56xx devices.  Use "make
	bcm.mousse.Z" or "make bcm.Z" to generate a compressed version;
	the boot ROM will also boot .Z images.

vxworks/idtrp334
	VxWorks BSP for the Broadcom MIPS CompactPCI card with an
	IDT RC32332/RC32334 CPU.  Has support for MMU mapping of the
	BCM56xx.  Despite a large number of warnings from the linker,
	this code runs and drives the StataSwitch.  Currently no flash
	disk is provided due to the large sector size.

	Use "make" or "make bcm" to generate bcm.idtrp334.  This same
	image will work on all supported BCM56xx devices.  Use "make
	bcm.idtrp334.Z" or "make bcm.Z" to generate a compressed version;
	the boot ROM will also boot .Z images.

vxworks/jag
	VxWorks BSP for the Broadcom BCM4704 MIPS CPU-based CompactPCI
	card (JAG).

	Use "make" or "make bcm" to generate bcm.jag.  This same
	image will work on all supported BCM56xx devices.  Use "make
	bcm.jag.Z" or "make bcm.Z" to generate a compressed version;
	the boot ROM will also boot .Z images.

vxworks/bmw
	Complete VxWorks BSP for the MPC8245-based SDK and reference
	designs from Broadcom, including: BMW (CPCI card), White Knight,
	Merlin, Galahad, and Lancelot.

	Use "make" or "make bcm" to generate bcm.bmw.  This same
	image will work on all supported BCM56xx devices.  Use "make
	bcm.bmw.Z" or "make bcm.Z" to generate a compressed version;
	the boot ROM will also boot .Z images.

sim
	This directory contains a simple main program stub that allows
	compilation of the BCM56xx driver and diagnostics shell under
	Linux and Solaris.  At Broadcom, this application connects via
	network to software Verilog simulations of the BCM56xx and other
	devices.  Building in this directory will also compile the
	PCI Daemon (pcid), see below.

sim/pcid
	This directory contains a very rudimentary StrataSwitch
	simulator called 'pcid', which models a subset of the chips,
	mainly the CMIC and other simple non-packet-switching functions.
	This is has been useful for writing the BCM library and
	diagnostics monitor commands without needing real hardware.

drv
	Systems driver library for miscellaneous additional drivers.

	Contains VxWorks SENS (Enhanced Network Driver) for BCM.  This
	requires either vxWorks 5.4 (Tornado 2) or VxWorks 5.3.x
	(Tornado 1) with the SENS patch loaded.  To configure the
	network driver from the BCM prompt:

	  maca * cbit=1	 # Configure the network interface MAC address range
	  ifconfig 1 =	 # Interactively configure and bring up port 1
			 # with user-specified IP parameters.

linux
	Linux driver directory.  This directory contains the source code
	for kernel driver modules allowing the BCM driver and diagnostic
	shell to be run either in the kernel or in user mode.
	NOTE 1: these are not Linux kernels, just linux modules.  Please
	refer to other README files in the systems/linux hierarchy for
	more information.
	NOTE 2: Broadcom is expanding and enhancing our Linux support
	for running the driver in both kernel mode and user mode.
	Broadcom can only help with problems relating to very specific
	versions of Linux and Linux distributions which we specify for
	development support (please contact your Broadcom Apps Engineer).

bde
	Broadcom Device Enumerator.
	This fundamental layer sits between the device driver and the
	underlying hardware and O/S and abstracts the methods for
	PCI setup, register access, and interrupt connection.  There are
	currently three BDEs:

	bde/vxworks
		Simple, direct PCI access methods for VxWorks.
	bde/pli
		PCI access methods for PLI and PCID simulator.
		Here, all PCI accesses are sent via RPC to a verilog model.
	bde/linux/kern
		PCI access methods for Linux kernel.
	bde/linux/user
		PCI access methods for Linux user mode.
		Here, PCI memory space is mapped into the user process
		and device interrupts are turned into signals.
		The entire driver and diagnostics shell can run in user mode.
