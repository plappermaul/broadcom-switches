 * File: cint_fid_demo.c
 * Purpose: Example for utilizing the field APIs. 
 *
 * You can modify the script to do the setup and tear down for various qualifiers and actions. 
 * The example illustrates how to install a rule to drop only Ethernet packets only if they fit 
 * a specific MAC source address and a specific EtherType.
 *
 * CINT usage:
 *  Create a bcm_field_group_t, then invoke field_api_setup(unit, prio, &group).
 *  Perform any frame testing desired.  
 *  Invoke field_api_teardown(unit, group).
 *
 *  Modify field_api_setup to fit your needs, or perhaps clone it several times
 *  for a number of different groups (but ensure that only one does the call to bcm_field_init).
 *  You can put more than one entry in each group, so each clone can set up several entries.

     *  Build qualifier set for the group we want to create.  Entries must exist
     *  within groups, and groups define what kind of things the entries can
     *  match, by their inclusion in the group's qualitier set.
     *
     *  In our little example, we expect to do L2 matching, so we include a few
     *  fields of interest for L2 work.  Right now, the field APIs do not separate
     *  frames according to their type, so if we wanted to do IPv4, we would
     *  still need to include, for example, EtherType (and set it to 0x0800 with
     *  all bits considered) in order to ensure only IPv4 frames hit.  We are not
     *  specifically required to include *all* L2 (or whatever) fields; in fact we
     *  may get better use of the TCAM space if we do not include qualifiers that
     *  we do not intend to use.
     *
     *  Also, we must specify stage ingress or egress.
     * 
     *  Note that only qualifiers specified in the QSET can be used by any of the
     *  entries in the group.  See the output from bcm_field_show(unit,"") for a
     *  list of the supported qualifiers per stage.
