 * wait for the thread to terminate itself.

 * If the thread has already exited, then this function will simply
 * clean up the resources associated with the thread.
 *
 * If the thread is still running, then a stop request will be issued,
 * and the function will wait for the thread to exit.
 *
 * If a timeout value of zero is specified, the function will return
 * immediately. In this case \ref shr_thread_stop must be called again
 * later with a non-zero timeout value to verify that the thread did
 * indeed stop. This mechanism allows a caller to wait in parallel for
 * multiple threads to terminate.
 *
 * An event-driven thread function will typical look as shown
 * below. When \ref shr_thread_stop is called, a stop request will be
 * issued and the thread will be woken up. The thread must check for a
 * stop request using \ref shr_thread_stopping and exit accordingly.
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * void my_thread(shr_thread_t th, void *arg)
 * {
 *     while (1) {
 *         shr_thread_sleep(th, SHR_THREAD_FOREVER);

 *
 *     rv = shr_thread_stop(th, 500000);
 *     ...

 * thread to terminate.
 *
 * \param [in] th Thread handle returned by \ref shr_thread_start.
