 * TM table's LT key combination to LTM track index transform handler.
 *
 * Some LTs have multiple keys, and each key combination should be associated to
 * one logical entry. In such cases, a transform function should be provided to
 * let LTM track the entries as it is a 1D indexed table.
 * The transform functions in this files is generic so that they can be applied
 * to all PTs with such fields.
