\section intro Overview

The SDK Custom Table Handler (CTH) library contains implementations
for Logical Tables which cannot be mapped to physical tables using
direct mapping or table transformations (LTX).

The makefile for the CTH library is built upon the make include files
in the <tt>$SDK/make</tt> directory.
