Build Hints
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAKE_PAR

	Set this environment variable to "-j" to achieve fast
	parallel builds of the BCM drivers.

NO_BCM

	Typing "gmake" in a systems/<TARGETBASE>/<TARGETPLAT> directory
	ordinarily builds bcm_libraries, driver_libraries, then the BSP,
	and links.  You can use "gmake NO_BCM=1" to avoid recompiling
	bcm_libraries driver_libraries if they are already built to your
	satisfaction.

DEBUG_OPTIMIZE

	When debugging, use "setenv DEBUG_OPTIMIZE FALSE" to turn off
	the -O flag.  Optimization severely cripples debugger accuracy.
	If DEBUG_OPTIMIZE is TRUE or not set, high optimization is used.
	Alternately you can set DEBUG_OPTIMIZE to your own option string
	such as "-O3".

BSP Descriptions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sim
	This directory contains a simple main program stub that allows
	compilation of the BCM56xx driver and diagnostics shell under
	Linux and Solaris.  At Broadcom, this application connects via
	network to software Verilog simulations of the BCM56xx and other
	devices.  Building in this directory will also compile the
	PCI Daemon (pcid), see below.

sim/pcid
	This directory contains a very rudimentary StrataSwitch
	simulator called 'pcid', which models a subset of the chips,
	mainly the CMIC and other simple non-packet-switching functions.
	This has been useful for writing the BCM library and
	diagnostics monitor commands without needing real hardware.

drv
	Systems driver library for miscellaneous additional drivers.

	Contains VxWorks SENS (Enhanced Network Driver) for BCM.  This
	requires either vxWorks 5.4 (Tornado 2) or VxWorks 5.3.x
	(Tornado 1) with the SENS patch loaded.  To configure the
	network driver from the BCM prompt:

          maca * cbit=1  # Configure the network interface MAC address range
          ifconfig 1 =   # Interactively configure and bring up port 1
                         # with user-specified IP parameters.

linux
	Linux driver directory.  This directory contains the source code
	for kernel driver modules.

bde
	Broadcom Device Enumerator.
	This fundamental layer sits between the device driver and the
	underlying hardware and O/S and abstracts the methods for
	PCI setup, register access, and interrupt connection.

        bde/pli
                PCI access methods for PLI and PCID simulator.
                Here, all PCI accesses are sent via RPC to a verilog model.
        bde/linux/kernel
                PCI access methods for Linux kernel.
        bde/linux/user
                PCI access methods for Linux user mode.
                Here, PCI memory space is mapped into the user process
                and device interrupts are turned into signals.
                The entire driver and diagnostics shell can run in user mode.
