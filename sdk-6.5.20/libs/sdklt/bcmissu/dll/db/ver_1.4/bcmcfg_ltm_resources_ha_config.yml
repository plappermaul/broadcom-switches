                 The software component configuration for bcmltm resources is derived\n

                             * The maximum number of logical tables referenced per transaction.
                             * This value determines the preparation of resources for atomic
                             * transaction support of modeled logical table operations.
                             * Minimum: 2, required to support TABLE_CONTROL
                             * Maximum: 32-bit integer, more than 64 not likely useful
                             * Default: 8
