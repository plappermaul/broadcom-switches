# file: component_actions.yml
# Attached component action functions to various stages of the ISSU process.
# These functions will be call per SYSM instance (per unit or generic).
# The two legitimate phases are pre_upgrade and post_upgrade. Currently only
# pre_upgrade is being used.
# The component name value should be the directory name under $SDK. This
# directory should have a sub-directory named issu_dll where the C file should
# be written. The C file must have a function that matches the handler name
# in the following format: <component_name>_<handler>. For example for the
# bcmimm component there should be a function named bcmimm_fl_id_hdl(int unit)
# The directory issu_dll should not be included in the targets.mk file as it
# will be build during the DLL build and not during the regular SDK build.
