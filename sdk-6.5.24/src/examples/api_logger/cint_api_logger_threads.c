 *
 *  Provides a filter/formatter function to process in-memory logging Entries.
 *  Concurrent API calls and Nested API calls can be detected and reported. API
 *  run-times can also be calculated and reported. Each of these outputs is
 *  enabled/disabled using its own boolean.
 *
 * Example shell command to invoke after sourcing this CINT:
 *
 *     LOGGER SHow FirstN=100000 ForMaTter=threader_fn
